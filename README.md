# Hierarchical PathPrediction (HPP)
The Hierarchical Path Prediction is an evaluation method to evaluate the ability of word embedding models to predict a hyponym (child) word given the hierarchical path (hypernym words/parents)

The script here is the source code for the proposed method and experiment eported in section 4.5 in the following paper:
This tool is the source codes for the proposed method reported in the published papers titled 
* "Joint Word Representation Learning Using a Corpus and a Semantic Lexicon" in AAAI-2016
* ["Jointly learning word embeddings using a corpus and a knowledge base" in PlosONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193094)
