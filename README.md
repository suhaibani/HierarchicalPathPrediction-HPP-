# Hierarchical PathPrediction (HPP)
The Hierarchical Path Prediction is an evaluation method to evaluate the ability of word embedding models to predict a hyponym (child) word given the hierarchical path (hypernym words/parents)

The script here is the source code for the proposed method and experiment eported in section 4.5 in the following paper:
